## User Story 2: Department User Creates Partner in Own Journal

### Scenario  
**Department User** (restrictedTopLevelJournalId = "40") creates Partner in Journal 40

### Workflow Overview
The approval chain is **identical** to User Story 1:
1. Root approval (Admin)
2. Level 1 approval (Manager)  
3. Level 2 approval (Department User - creator)

**Key Difference:**
- Department User created the partner but still must wait for hierarchical approval
- Department User cannot approve until Root and Level 1 have approved first
- Department User sees their own creation as `pending[2, 0]` initially but cannot approve it

### Visual Feedback
- Disabled [APPROVE] buttons when not user's turn
- Clear messaging about required approval sequence  
- Progress indicators showing current position in chain
- Approval history showing who approved and when

### Bulk Operations
- **Future enhancement**: Select multiple pending items for batch approval
